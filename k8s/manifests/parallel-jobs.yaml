# TTG Parallel Jobs - Kubernetes Job Manifest
#
# This creates a parallel Job that distributes work across multiple workers.
# Each worker processes a different range of parameters.
#
# How it works:
#   - Creates 3 parallel pods (workers)
#   - Each pod gets a unique JOB_COMPLETION_INDEX (0, 1, 2)
#   - Worker uses this index as WORKER_ID to determine its parameter range
#
# Deploy:
#   kubectl apply -f parallel-jobs.yaml
#
# Monitor:
#   kubectl get jobs
#   kubectl get pods -l job-name=ttg-computation
#   kubectl logs -l job-name=ttg-computation --all-containers
#
# Clean up:
#   kubectl delete -f parallel-jobs.yaml
